abstract="We propose a walking guidance method with a sandal-shaped vibration interface and describe two experiments we performed to formulate the design principles of the interface. In the interface, a vibrating motor presents timing information to the foot, and pressure sensors measure walking pace. Our method is a combination of the walking-state monitoring and vibro-tactile feedback to maintain or promote a walking pace. Vibration stimuli with a constant presentation interval are alternately and repeatedly given to the right or left foot of the user according to the measured walking pace, and then the walking pace gradually conforms to the presented interval of the vibration. In the experiments, we specified the effective timing and intervals of the vibration stimuli for efficient inductance of walking pace. The method is applicable for training and coaching in sports and rehabilitation in health care.",

abstract={It is known that interacting with virtual objects enhances users' understanding and interests more effectively than learning through passive media. However, compared with the passive media, the excessive amount of information and interactive options in most virtual reality settings may cause users to quit exploring before they experience the entire content of the virtual world. In this paper, we propose a new guidance method to implicitly lead users to pre-defined locations in the virtual environment while continuing to permit free explorations by using a kind of potential field (guidance field). The guidance field is composed of two independent mechanisms: locomotion guidance and rotation guidance. We implemented our method in a virtual museum exploring system and exhibited it in a real museum to evaluate the effectiveness of our method when used by a large number of people. The result suggests that our method successfully guides users to pre-defined locations and makes users aware of pre-defined objects. Moreover, the results suggest that our guidance may not interfere users' arbitrary explorations.},

abstract={Comparatively little research exists on rendering vibrotactile patterns, or tactons, to the sole of the foot. However, it may be a natural placement for vibrotactile stimulation for navigation tasks, posture and gait rehabilitation. Similarly, it may be more appropriate to render general haptic feedback to the foot when such vibrations would be distracting if delivered to other body parts. This motivated our development of a custom instrumented haptic insole, which incorporates four actuators, designed to deliver vibrotactile stimulation to the foot. As an initial test, we conducted a user study measuring recognition rates of tactons rendered during quiet stance and gait. Since actuator coupling and foot sensitivity change during gait, our insole uses a proximity sensor to detect footfall, allowing for consistent triggering at a defined point in the gait cycle when the actuators should be best coupled to the sole of the foot. We found that although overall recognition while standing (>92%) is much better than while walking (>66%), the majority of errors are confined to patterns that begin with the same actuator. Our initial evaluation shows promise for application of the insole, such as for sensorimotor rehabilitation and general human-computer interaction.},

On the basis of dynamic system theory, negative emotion states are predicted to reduce correlated variability whereas sustained attention is expected to reduce total respiratory variability. Both are predicted to evoke sighing. To test this, respiratory variability and sighing were assessed during a baseline, stressful mental arithmetic task, nonstressful sustained attention task, and recovery in between tasks. For respiration rate (excluding sighs), reduced total variability was found during the attention task, whereas correlated variation was reduced during mental load. Sigh rate increased during mental load and during recovery from the attention task. It is concluded that mental load and task-related attention show specific patterns in respiratory variability and sigh rate.},

Normalized regional cerebral blood flow was measured while subjects mentally navigated between landmarks of a route which had been previously learned by actual navigation. This task was contrasted with both static visual imagery of landmarks (VIL) and silent Rest. MSR appears to be subserved by two distinct networks: a non-specific memory network including the posterior and middle parts of the hippocampal regions, the dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex and the posterior cingulum, and a specific mental navigation network, comprising the left precuneus, insula and medial part of the hippocampal regions.},

abstract = "Abstract Physical guidance is often used in rehabilitation when teaching patients to re-learn movements. However, the effects of guidance on motor learning of complex skills, such as walking balance, are not clear. We tested four groups of healthy subjects that practiced walking on a narrow (1.27cm) or wide (2.5cm) treadmill-mounted balance beam, with or without physical guidance. Assistance was given by springs attached to a hip belt that applied restoring forces towards beam center. Subjects were evaluated while walking unassisted before and after training by calculating the number of times subjects stepped off of the beam per minute of successful walking on the beam (Failures per Minute). Subjects in Unassisted groups had greater performance improvements in walking balance from pre to post compared to subjects in Assisted groups. During training, Unassisted groups had more Failures per Minute than Assisted groups. Performance improvements were smaller in Narrow Beam groups than in Wide Beam groups. The Unassisted-Wide and Assisted-Narrow groups had similar Failures per Minute during training, but the Unassisted-Wide group had much greater performance gains after training. These results suggest that physical assistance can hinder motor learning of walking balance, assistance appears less detrimental for more difficult tasks, and task-specific dynamics are important to learning independent of error experience."

abstract = "Abstract The nature of coordination changes and stability features in the relative phase dynamics of the trunk were examined in seven healthy subjects, while walking velocity on a treadmill was gradually increased and decreased. Predictions from SchÃ¶ner et al. (J. Theor. Biol. 142, 359â€“391, 1990) regarding transition mechanisms in quadrupedal walking generalized to pelvis-thorax phase relations in bipedal walking, in that more continuous transitions with and without loss of stability were observed when walking velocity was manipulated as a control parameter. Relative phase changed from more in-phase (about 25Â°) at lower velocities to more out-of-phase (about 110Â°) at higher velocities. Stability analysis of relative phase demonstrated the existence of more than one stable coordination pattern (â€˜multistabilityâ€™). Total ranges of motion in pelvis, thorax, and trunk, as well as stride length were larger at the decreasing velocity range as compared to the increasing velocity range, showing dependence on direction of control parameter manipulation (â€˜hysteresis effectâ€™). The nature of these transitions identifies phase relations in the trunk in human walking as lower symmetry dynamics, a finding consistent with the proposed dynamics of the quadrupedal walking mode. These results suggest the existence of different coordination patterns (multistability) in the human bipedal walking mode and question traditional distinctions in only two modes (walking and running) in human gait."
