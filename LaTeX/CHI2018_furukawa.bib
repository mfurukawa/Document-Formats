abstract="We propose a walking guidance method with a sandal-shaped vibration interface and describe two experiments we performed to formulate the design principles of the interface. In the interface, a vibrating motor presents timing information to the foot, and pressure sensors measure walking pace. Our method is a combination of the walking-state monitoring and vibro-tactile feedback to maintain or promote a walking pace. Vibration stimuli with a constant presentation interval are alternately and repeatedly given to the right or left foot of the user according to the measured walking pace, and then the walking pace gradually conforms to the presented interval of the vibration. In the experiments, we specified the effective timing and intervals of the vibration stimuli for efficient inductance of walking pace. The method is applicable for training and coaching in sports and rehabilitation in health care.",

Simulations of footstep sounds upon surface materials such as concrete and snow were provided by means of a system composed of headphones and shoes augmented with sensors. In a control condition, participants could hear their actual footstep sounds. Results showed an overall enhancement of the forward drift after treadmill walking independent of the sound perceived, while the strength of the aftereffect, measured as the proportional increase (posttest/pretest) in forward drift, was higher under the influence of snow compared to both concrete and actual sound. In addition, a higher knee angle flexion was found during the snow sound condition both before and after treadmill walking. Behavioral results confirmed those of a perceptual questionnaire, which showed that the snow sound was effective in producing strong pseudo-haptic illusions. Our results provide evidence that the walking in place aftereffect results from a recalibration of haptic, visuo-motor but also sound-motor control systems. Self-motion perception is multimodal.",

abstract = "Abstract Previous research has shown that walkers provided with interactive simulations of footstep sounds on a surface material different from the one they are walking upon, experience pseudo-haptic illusions and adjust their walking kinematic according to the perceived surfaces’ compliance. Since walking on real grounds with different degrees of compliance leads to different metabolic costs, an open question is whether pseudo-haptic illusions created by interactive footstep sounds are able to affect the metabolic parameters. This study investigated whether metabolic cost and movement’s kinematics are affected by such interactive auditory feedback in a constrained condition as walking on a treadmill. Participants were walking on a treadmill under three listening conditions: actual footsteps sounds, interactive simulations of footstep sounds on gravel and snow. The metabolic and kinematic data, as well as the perceived exertion, sense of effort, easiness, and feeling of sinking were recorded. Results showed that interactive footstep sounds provided during treadmill walking did not affect kinematic and metabolic parameters of walking, while they were effective in modulating participants’ perception. These results suggest that in a constrained and non self-selected pattern of locomotion the sound of action, even though correctly perceived, is not strong enough to induce a change in the metabolic and kinematics of the locomotion."

abstract={It is known that interacting with virtual objects enhances users' understanding and interests more effectively than learning through passive media. However, compared with the passive media, the excessive amount of information and interactive options in most virtual reality settings may cause users to quit exploring before they experience the entire content of the virtual world. In this paper, we propose a new guidance method to implicitly lead users to pre-defined locations in the virtual environment while continuing to permit free explorations by using a kind of potential field (guidance field). The guidance field is composed of two independent mechanisms: locomotion guidance and rotation guidance. We implemented our method in a virtual museum exploring system and exhibited it in a real museum to evaluate the effectiveness of our method when used by a large number of people. The result suggests that our method successfully guides users to pre-defined locations and makes users aware of pre-defined objects. Moreover, the results suggest that our guidance may not interfere users' arbitrary explorations.},

abstract={Comparatively little research exists on rendering vibrotactile patterns, or tactons, to the sole of the foot. However, it may be a natural placement for vibrotactile stimulation for navigation tasks, posture and gait rehabilitation. Similarly, it may be more appropriate to render general haptic feedback to the foot when such vibrations would be distracting if delivered to other body parts. This motivated our development of a custom instrumented haptic insole, which incorporates four actuators, designed to deliver vibrotactile stimulation to the foot. As an initial test, we conducted a user study measuring recognition rates of tactons rendered during quiet stance and gait. Since actuator coupling and foot sensitivity change during gait, our insole uses a proximity sensor to detect footfall, allowing for consistent triggering at a defined point in the gait cycle when the actuators should be best coupled to the sole of the foot. We found that although overall recognition while standing (>92%) is much better than while walking (>66%), the majority of errors are confined to patterns that begin with the same actuator. Our initial evaluation shows promise for application of the insole, such as for sensorimotor rehabilitation and general human-computer interaction.},

None of these systems work seamlessly both indoors and outdoors. Drishti uses a precise position measurement system, a wireless connection, a wearable computer, and a vocal communication interface to guide blind users and help them travel in familiar and unfamiliar environments independently and safely. Outdoors, it uses DGPS as its location system to keep the user as close as possible to the central line of sidewalks of campus and downtown areas; it provides the user with an optimal route by means of its dynamic routing and rerouting ability. The user can switch the system from an outdoor to an indoor environment with a simple vocal command. An OEM ultrasound positioning system is used to provide precise indoor location measurements. Experiments show an in-door accuracy of 22 cm. The user can get vocal prompts to avoid possible obstacles and step-by-step walking guidance to move about in an indoor environment. This paper describes the Drishti system and focuses on the indoor navigation design and lessons learned in integrating the indoor with the outdoor system.},

abstract = {This study examines three hypotheses that have been proposed to explain the effects of galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) in standing human subjects. The first assumes realignment to an altered representation of vertical. GVS-evoked body tilt produced under conditions of different stability was compared with perceptions of the vertical which subjects indicated by two means, a visual line and a manipulandum. GVS produced body tilt that increased in unstable conditions but there were no differences in the perceived vertical in any condition. The second hypothesis is that the altered vestibular signal is interpreted as a tilt of the support surface. The postural response evoked by tilting the support surface was compared with the GVS response under conditions of varying stability. These responses were different, particularly for the lower body where movements were oppositely directed. Standing on foam augmented GVS responses whereas standing with feet apart augmented platform-tilt responses. The third hypothesis is that GVS produces an illusion of movement, and this causes a reaction in the opposite direction. Perception of movement during GVS was determined in standing and immobilised subjects. Although immobilised subjects experienced illusions of movement in the direction opposite the sway response, this only happened after long periods of stimulation and never for standing where subjects accurately reported the true direction of sway. Thus, the results do not support any of these proposals. Instead, they and other observations support a simpler interpretation that the GVS signal is consistent with head movement and evokes an automated response to stabilise the head in space.},

* 1To identify vestibular influences on human walking, galvanic vestibular stimulation was applied to normal adult subjects as they walked to a previously seen target. A transmastoidal step stimulus commenced as subjects started walking. With the eyes shut, the galvanic stimulus caused large turns towards the side with the anodal current.

* 2Ability to perceive the trajectory of gait without visual cues was measured by guiding blindfolded subjects from one arbitrary point to another, either walking or seated in a wheelchair. On reaching a destination position and removing the blindfold, subjects pointed to indicate the starting position. Subjects made considerable errors in estimating the trajectory, but were equally accurate whether in the wheelchair or walking.

* 3To determine the effects of vestibular stimulation on the perception of trajectory, the galvanic stimulus was applied to blindfolded subjects as they were guided from one point to another in the wheelchair. The vestibular stimulus produced an illusory shift in the trajectory travelled. This shift was towards the side with the cathode, i.e. in the opposite direction to the turn produced by the stimulus during walking.

* 4We conclude that galvanic vestibular stimulation during walking causes subjects to turn from their planned trajectory. In part, this altered course may compensate for an altered perception of trajectory produced by the stimulus. However, altered perception of the vertical or the base of support, or direct vestibulo-fugal influences on the leg muscles could contribute to the changes in gait.

abstract="Application of a small (around 1 mA), constant electric current between the mastoid processes (galvanic stimulation) of a standing subject produces enhanced body sway in the approximate direction of the ear behind which the anode is placed. We examined the electromyographic (EMG) responses evoked by such stimulation in the soleus and in the triceps brachii muscles. For soleus, subjects stood erect, with their eyes closed, leaning slightly forward. The head was turned approximately 90{\textdegree} to the right or left relative to the feet. In averaged records (n=40), current pulses of 25 ms or longer modulated the EMG in a biphasic manner: a small early component (latency 62{\textpm}2.4 ms, mean {\textpm} SEM) was followed by a larger late component (latency 115{\textpm}5.2ms) of opposite sign, which was appropriate to produce the observed body sway. The early component produced no measurable body movement. Lengthening the duration of the stimulus pulse from 25 to 400 ms prolonged the late component of the response but had little effect on the early component. Short- and long-latency EMG responses were also evoked in the triceps brachii muscle if subjects stood on a transversely pivoted platform and had to use the muscle to maintain their balance in the anteroposterior plane by holding a fixed handle placed by the side of their hip. The latency of the early component was 41{\textpm}2.6 ms; the latency of the late component was 138{\textpm}4.3 ms and was again of appropriate sign for producing the observed body sway. Galvanic stimulation evoked no comparable responses in either triceps brachii or soleus muscles if these muscles were not being used posturally. The responses were most prominent if vestibular input provided the dominant source of information about postural stability, and were much smaller if subjects lightly touched a fixed support or opened their eyes. The difference in latency between the onset of the early component of the response in arm and leg muscles suggests that this part of the response uses a descending pathway which conducts impulses down the spinal cord with a velocity comparable with that of the fast conducting component of the corticospinal tract. The late component of the EMG response occurs earlier in the leg than the arm. We suggest that it forms part of a patterned, functional response which is computed independently of the early component.",

Anodal threshold levels of GVS were determined for right and left sides for each subject. Seven conditions were tested (no stimulation, left and right anode stimulation) at one, two and three times threshold. GVS was delivered to the mastoid processes at first heel contact and continued for the duration of the trial. All subjects responded by deviating towards the anode while walking. In addition, the magnitude of deviation increased as the stimulus intensity increased. Our results demonstrate that the vestibular system is sensitive to GVS intensity changes and responds by altering the magnitude of the response accordingly. These data provide a strong argument in support of a significant role for vestibular information during dynamic tasks."

The EEG was recorded bipolarly with electrode placement over the hand and foot representation areas. The aim of the study was to demonstrate for the first time that it is possible to move through a virtual street without muscular activity when the participant only imagines feet movements. This is achieved by exploiting a brain–computer interface (BCI) which transforms thought-modulated EEG signals into an output signal that controls events within the VE. The experiments were carried out in an immersive projection environment, commonly referred to as a “Cave” (Cruz-Neira, C., Sandin, D.J., DeFanti, T.A., Surround-screen projection-based virtual reality: the design and implementation of the CAVE. Proceedings of the 20th annual conference on Computer graphics and interactive techniques, ACM Press, 1993, pp. 135–142) where participants were able to move through a virtual street by foot imagery only. Prior to the final experiments in the Cave, the participants underwent an extensive BCI training."

abstract = "Abstract A deterministic model was developed and validated to calculate instantaneous ankle and knee moments during walking using processed EMG from representative muscles, instantaneous joint angle as a correlate of muscle length and angular velocity as a correlate of muscle velocity, and having available total instantaneous joint moments for derivation of certain model parameters. A linear regression of the moment on specifically processed EMG, recorded while each subject performed cycled isometric calibration contractions, yielded the constants for a basic moment-EMG relationship. Using the resultant moment for optimization, the predicted moment was proportionally augmented for longer muscle lengths and reduced for shorter lengths. Similarly, the predicted moment was reduced for shortening velocities and increased if the muscle was lengthening. The plots of moments predicted using the full model and those calculated from link segment mechanics followed each other quite closely. The range of root mean square errors were: 3.2–9.5 Nm for the ankle and 4.7–13.0 Nm for the knee."

On the basis of dynamic system theory, negative emotion states are predicted to reduce correlated variability whereas sustained attention is expected to reduce total respiratory variability. Both are predicted to evoke sighing. To test this, respiratory variability and sighing were assessed during a baseline, stressful mental arithmetic task, nonstressful sustained attention task, and recovery in between tasks. For respiration rate (excluding sighs), reduced total variability was found during the attention task, whereas correlated variation was reduced during mental load. Sigh rate increased during mental load and during recovery from the attention task. It is concluded that mental load and task-related attention show specific patterns in respiratory variability and sigh rate.},

Normalized regional cerebral blood flow was measured while subjects mentally navigated between landmarks of a route which had been previously learned by actual navigation. This task was contrasted with both static visual imagery of landmarks (VIL) and silent Rest. MSR appears to be subserved by two distinct networks: a non-specific memory network including the posterior and middle parts of the hippocampal regions, the dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex and the posterior cingulum, and a specific mental navigation network, comprising the left precuneus, insula and medial part of the hippocampal regions.},

However, the effects of guidance on motor learning of complex skills, such as walking balance, are not clear. We tested four groups of healthy subjects that practiced walking on a narrow (1.27cm) or wide (2.5cm) treadmill-mounted balance beam, with or without physical guidance. Assistance was given by springs attached to a hip belt that applied restoring forces towards beam center. Subjects were evaluated while walking unassisted before and after training by calculating the number of times subjects stepped off of the beam per minute of successful walking on the beam (Failures per Minute). Subjects in Unassisted groups had greater performance improvements in walking balance from pre to post compared to subjects in Assisted groups. During training, Unassisted groups had more Failures per Minute than Assisted groups. Performance improvements were smaller in Narrow Beam groups than in Wide Beam groups. The Unassisted-Wide and Assisted-Narrow groups had similar Failures per Minute during training, but the Unassisted-Wide group had much greater performance gains after training. These results suggest that physical assistance can hinder motor learning of walking balance, assistance appears less detrimental for more difficult tasks, and task-specific dynamics are important to learning independent of error experience."

Predictions from Schöner et al. (J. Theor. Biol. 142, 359–391, 1990) regarding transition mechanisms in quadrupedal walking generalized to pelvis-thorax phase relations in bipedal walking, in that more continuous transitions with and without loss of stability were observed when walking velocity was manipulated as a control parameter. Relative phase changed from more in-phase (about 25°) at lower velocities to more out-of-phase (about 110°) at higher velocities. Stability analysis of relative phase demonstrated the existence of more than one stable coordination pattern (‘multistability’). Total ranges of motion in pelvis, thorax, and trunk, as well as stride length were larger at the decreasing velocity range as compared to the increasing velocity range, showing dependence on direction of control parameter manipulation (‘hysteresis effect’). The nature of these transitions identifies phase relations in the trunk in human walking as lower symmetry dynamics, a finding consistent with the proposed dynamics of the quadrupedal walking mode. These results suggest the existence of different coordination patterns (multistability) in the human bipedal walking mode and question traditional distinctions in only two modes (walking and running) in human gait."

Displacement curves per stride cycle were described by means of harmonic analysis. Simple mechanical, or geometrical models of the body's center of mass (COM) tajectory during walking were used to predict amplitude and timing of pelvic displacements. As predicted by inverted pendulum models, the amplitude of pelvic displacement in vertical direction depended on stride length. Anterior-posterior displacements were predicted by assuming equal maxima of potential and forward kinetic energy of the body. Predictions for left-right displacements were based upon a model that assumed a constant stride width and a sinusoidal movement pattern. In agreement with this model, the amplitude of pelvic displacement in left-right direction depended on stride frequency. The presented models give insight into mechanical mechanisms which determine the pelvic trajectory during walking. The presented data may be useful in the clinical evaluation of gait disturbances."

Here, we use an artificial neural network (ANN) approach to first derive an EMG–force relationship from a subset of experimentally determined EMGs and muscle forces; second, we use this relationship to predict individual muscle forces for different contractile conditions and in subjects whose EMG and force data were not used in the derivation of the EMG–force relationship; and third, we validate the predicted muscle forces against the known forces recorded in vivo. EMG and muscle forces were recorded from the cat soleus for a variety of locomotor conditions giving a data base from three subjects, four locomotor conditions, and 8–16 steps per subject and condition. Considering the conceptual differences in the tasks investigated (e.g. slow walking vs. trotting), the intra-subject results obtained here are superior to those published previously, even though the approach did not require a muscle model or the instantaneous contractile conditions as input for the force predictions. The inter-subject results are the first of this kind to be presented in the literature and they typically gave cross-correlation coefficients between actual and predicted forces of >0.90 and root mean square errors of <15%, thus they were considered excellent. From the results of this study, it was concluded that ANNs represent a powerful tool to capture the essential features of EMG–force relationships of dynamically contracting muscle, and that ANNs might be used widely to predict muscle forces based on EMG signals."

The central and peripheral areas of the observers' visual field were simultaneously stimulated by random dot patterns that moved in opposite directions. The results of two experiments indicated that the effects of central and peripheral presentations of the moving visual pattern are equivalent, and that vection strength is determined by the stimulus size and speed but not by its eccentricity. These results are consistent with the findings of previous studies that suggested that there are no qualitative differences in the vection-inducing potentials of the central and peripheral areas of the visual field, and are counter to the more traditional hypothesis, which has assumed that the perception of self-motion is specifically assigned to peripheral vision.},
